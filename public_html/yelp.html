                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>A new feature within the existing Yelp interface that allows people to compare search results so that they can quickly make decisions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-element">
                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>This Yelp redesign was created in 3 weeks for a course on interface design. We had the opportunity to work within Yelp and research the ins and outs of how it worked.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-element">
                    <h2>Current Service</h2>
                    <p>Yelp’s purpose is to provide a way for connecting people to local businesses through community published reviews, ratings, and photos to influence their decision and choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>After going through the app and its interface ourselves and with user testers, we discovered 2 insights of major disconnects of the user and the interface.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span>01</span>
                            <p>First, most people do not use Yelp to look for local businesses but rather other services such as Google Maps where they offer only the surface level information, whereas Yelp inundates people with large amounts of information. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>02</span>
                            <p>Second, during our user testing sessions with people who frequently use Yelp, we found them frustrated at having to go to extreme lengths in order to navigate around the app.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="section-element">
                    <h2>Persona</h2>
                    <p>From the key insights drawn from our user testers, we developed a persona for Yelp:</p>

                </div>
                <div class="section-element">
                    <h2>Solution Development</h2>
                    <p>Josh and I began to brainstorm possible solutions to address the 2 key insights:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span>01</span>
                            <p> Quick Review – an additional way for Yelp users to quickly review local businesses using ratings for keywords describing it.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>02</span>
                            <p>Compare – a feature to allow for comparisons of search results of local businesses to reduce cognitive load.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We chose to pursue the Compare feature as it fully related to both of the major insights that we initially drew.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, I began to wireframe how they feature would work alongside Yelp’s content-heavy information architecture.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/yelp-wireframes.png">
                    <p>Then I started to build the full fidelity mockup for this feature.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-element">
                    <div class="grid-container">

                            <h2>Flow</h2>
                            <p>To use this feature, the user just simply begins a search for a local business that provides a service that they are looking for. The app would then present an onboarding tutorial for using this feature for the first time.</p>
                            <p>After seeing the initial results, the user can toggle the feature on and select the local businesses that they would want to take a closer look at.</p>
                            <p>Once they’re happy with the selection, the user can compare each business that they had selected on a separate page, lowering their cognitive load. It is also possible to go back and change which ones the user wants to compare.</p>

                        <div class="grid-col-1of2">

                            <h2>Shortcut</h2>
                            <p>To provide flexibility and efficiency to the compare feature, we included an accelerator or a shortcut allowing the user to “press and hold” the desired business to enable the compare function, essentially minimizing the steps to perform the process. This shortcut is intended for expert users who become used to this feature where it allows them to navigate towards their goal more efficiently.

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Looking back, I think something for me to think about next time is making sure that I use time wisely in terms of allocating how much time should go into each component. I think that while I was more focused on the research we had done, I could have explored more into developing how the feature would be more in tune to Yelp’s purpose on the interface.</p>
