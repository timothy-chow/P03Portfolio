                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Anec + Dote is an e-commerce website that provides a platform for people to buy beautifully printed literature as well as lifestyle articles and news about the arts.

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>This project was an opportunity to build a platform on the web as well as an introduction to working with GitKraken and repositories. When given an e-commerce website with products as the brief, we researched and explored what current e-commerce platforms were like in their information architecture and responsiveness on different screen sizes. We then chose to go through with a platform that sells designed and printed books.

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>Before beginning to code the project, I began to sketch out wireframes of what the site may look like followed by digital mockups of a userâ€™s workflow. Despite knowing how to start coding a website in HTML and CSS, my partner and I were halted by a lack of knowledge in using repositories as it was our first time using them. From this experience, I learned to adapt, think fast, and improvise my way around a problem so that I can allocate my time more wisely.

                            <h2>Build</h2>
                            <p>After figuring out how to use GitKraken, I began to build pages and develop a visual identity for Anec + Dote. My key roles were fleshing out the grid structure and responsiveness of the website as well as incorporating elements of JavaScript into it.

                            </h2>
                            <p>Something I took away from this project was to be very detailed oriented in terms of how the interactions of a web page can be friendly if coded well or it can become abrupt if no care or attention is paid to it.
